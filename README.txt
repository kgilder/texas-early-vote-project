The purpose of this project is to create a simple way for voters in the state of Texas to request an application 
to vote by mail. 

The process is complex and has only been worsened by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemit. This has greatly increased the 
need to vote by mail, a necessary precaution to protect the health of all voters, while at the same time protecting
their right to vote. Unfortunately, a significant effort will stil be required of any voter in the state of Texas, 
but my hope is to simplify that process slightly and to inform voters of Texas how to safely carry out their
civic duty. 

All the best, 
Ken
